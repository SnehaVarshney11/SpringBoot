# SpringBoot
* It is a module of spring from which we speed up the development.
* It creates standalone, production-grade applications that you can just run.
* It provides rapid development applications and automatic configuration.
* It scans the classpath and finds the dependency it will automatically configure the things.
* Spring framework + embedded server - configuration = Spring Boot
* @SpringBootApplication - @Configurtion + @EnableAutoConfiguration + @ComponentScan.
* We can declare the bean, auto-config enable and also scan the package
* <b>Advantage</b> - creates a stand-alone application that can be started using jar, provide the server, automatically configure library, no requirement for XML 
configuration

## Ways to create a project
1. create a maven project and add starter dependencies
2. using spring initializr -> Download it and open it in Eclipse - Go to import - Existing Maven project - select the project and import it  
3. use IDE like STS (Spring Tool Suite) -> Best Method
4. Spring Boot CLI

## How to create JSP Views 
* <b>STEPS</b> <br>
  ðŸ‘‰<i>Create a Controller class in src/main/java</i><br>
  ![Screenshot (154)](https://github.com/SnehaVarshney11/SpringBoot/assets/78306516/5fef3aa0-3ff8-4f73-b64b-a0457dc97542)
  ðŸ‘‰<i>Add suffix and prefix in application.properties file for view name </i><br>
  ðŸ‘‰<i>Add webapp and views folders in src/main/webapp/view. Create jsp files here </i><br>
  ![Screenshot (155)](https://github.com/SnehaVarshney11/SpringBoot/assets/78306516/88b941f1-48c4-41d4-8bf2-10fe9867af94)
  ðŸ‘‰<i>In pom.xml add tomcat-embed-jasper dependency otherwise It will not show the content of jsp page, it will download the file</i><br>
  
* <b>Use of application.properties file </b><br>
  ðŸ‘‰ This is a configuration file. <br>
  ðŸ‘‰ Spring Boot provides a preconfigured application, If we want to customize the properties, we can do it in this file.
  Ex- If we are running the project and it shows that the server is already in use, we can write our port number to run the application.<br>
  ðŸ‘‰ So It contains a key-value pair. Ex- server.port = 8081  <br>

## JPA (Java Persistence API)
* Persistence means storing something permanently.
* JPA is an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tool. ORM is a third-party tool, that will store the data and also convert the data (which is in table-row, col-based) into an object.
* If we do not use ORM, we must write the SQL query for db. Here ORM plays an important role, it will fetch the data from the table and convert it into an object. Here we don't have to write the SQL query. ORM will also convert the object into SQL.
* Hibernate is an implementation of JPA.
* JPA provides us <b>EntityManagerFactory(provides EntityManager's object), EntityManager(provides CRUD operations).</b>

### How Spring Boot Makes it Easier to Perform Operations with JPA
* Add spring-boot-starter-data-jpa dependency. It will configure all the dependencies automatically.
* Now we have to perform some operations on a user (example) and then create UserRepository (same as DAO) which extends CRUDRepository. If we don't want to extend the CRUDRepository, then we can use JPARepository, a child of CRUDRepository that will provide more functionality. CRUDRepository and JPARepository are both interfaces.
* While working on JPA project, we need to add dependencies of MySql driver, JPA, and web (if working on a web project)
* To save and get the entities, we need to write a Repository interface for them which will be created in the DAO package.
* JPA with Spring boot configuring database information in application.properties file.
* Need to install MySql workbench.

### STEPS to setting up a basic JPA example. (Code in JPAExample folder)
1. Create an entity class(ex- user.java) define the properties (name, city etc.)
```
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.GenerationType;
import javax.persistence.Id;

 @Entity
   public class User {

     @Id
     @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
     private Long id;
     private String name;
     private String city;
     private String status;
    // Getters and setters, constructors, and other methods...
    }

```
2. Create a Dao class (ex-UserRepository.java)
```
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;

public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
    // Additional custom queries can be defined here if needed
}
```
3. In application.properties file add all the imortant configurations.
 ```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_schema_name
spring.datasource.username=your_mysql_username
spring.datasource.password=your_mysql_password
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```
4. Create schema in Mysql workbench.
```
You can create the schema manually or let Hibernate create it for you if spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update is set. Be cautious with this in a production environment.
```
7. Create the object of entity to get all the properties which are defined in entity class.
```
package com.jpa.test;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;

import com.jpa.test.dao.UserRepository;
import com.jpa.test.entities.User;

@SpringBootApplication
public class JpaExampleApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		ApplicationContext context = SpringApplication.run(JpaExampleApplication.class, args);
		UserRepository ur = context.getBean(UserRepository.class);
		
		User user = new User();
		user.setName("Sneha");
		user.setCity("Delhi");
		user.setStatus("I am Java Programmer");
		
		User obj = ur.save(user);
		System.out.println(obj);
	}

}
```

### Custom Finder Method
* By default, CRUDRepository provides us find methods - findById(), findAll(), findAllById(). If we want to find data by name, by name and password, by name or password, starting/ending name by suffix/prefix. In this case, SpringBoot allows us to create custom methods or Derived Query Methods.
* These methods will be created in the interface (UserRepository.java)
* These methods work on JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language).
```
package com.jpa.test.dao;

import java.util.List;

import org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository;

import com.jpa.test.entities.User;

public interface UserRepository extends CrudRepository<User, Integer>{
	// Custom Finder Method
	public List<User> findByName(String name);
	public List<User> findByNameAndCity(String name, String city);
}
```
* <b>Supported Keywords</b> - <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/jpa/query-methods.html">DOCS</a>

### Executing JPQL and Native Queries with Spring Data JPA
* We can execute queries using @Query annotation.
```
package com.jpa.test.dao;

import java.util.List;

import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.Query;
import org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository;
import org.springframework.data.repository.query.Param;

import com.jpa.test.entities.User;

public interface UserRepository extends CrudRepository<User, Integer>{
	//Custom Query 
	@Query("select u from User u") //JPQL 
	public List<User> getAllUser();
	
	@Query("select u from User u where u.name =:n") //JPQL
	public List<User> getUserByName(@Param("n") String name);
	
	@Query(value = "select * from User", nativeQuery = true) //SQL 
	public List<User> getUsers();
}
```

## API
* API means Application Programming Interface.
* It is a set of rules that allows programs to talk to each other. The developers create the API on the server and allow the client to talk to it.
* Example- In FaceBook/Instagram, we upload our pics. Pics are uploaded by using API.
### REST (Representational State Transfer) API
* A set of constraints for creating web services(API). In simple words, It's a rule to create APIs.
* It is a part of API.
* Ex- Client-Server Architecture, Stateless Architecture, Cacheable, Layered etc.
* <b>Rules - </b> The important methods of HTTP are-
  1. GET- It reads a resource.
  2. POST-It creates a new resource.
  3. PUT- It updates an existing resource.
  4. DELETE- It deletes a resource.
* HTTP also defined the following status-
  1. 404 - Page/Resource not found
  2. 200 - Success
  3. 201 - Created
  4. 401 - Unauthorized
  5. 500 - Server Error
* When there is any request on the server, will be handled by the controller.
* While using rest API, use @RestController instead of @Controller
 
## Spring Boot DevTools
* DevTools stands for Development Tool. This tool aims to reduce the time of development while working on spring-boot. Spring boot dev tools pickup the changes and restart the application. 
* Add a dependency in the pom.xml file.
```
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>
	<Scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```
* Features -
  1. Property Default - By using this tool, code will not be stored in cache memory. Sometimes we are providing color in our template and color doesn't work because of the cache and in this case, we have to clear the cache. This problem will be handled by this tool.
  2. Automatic restart - After some changes, it will automatically restart the application.
  3. Live Reload

## Creation of API
* There is a client called Postman. It will create, read, update, and delete the user (Ex- Book).
1. READ - <br>
   â­• On the Server Side - Create the controller, it will process it and give a response in JSON format. <br>
   â­• On Client Side (Postman) - send URL - ip/books to a server, receive a response from the server. <br>
   â­• Method will be GET. <br>
2. CREATE - <br>
   â­• IP Address - /name (ex- /books) but the method will be POST. <br>
3. DELETE - <br>
   â­• IP Address - /name/{id} but the method will be DELETE. <br>
4. UPDATE - <br>
   â­• IP Address - /name/{id} (ex- /books) but the method will be PUT. <br>

## ResponseEntity
* Used to handle HttpStatus while creating REST API.
* Extension of HttpEntity that adds an HttpStatusCode status code.
* Used in RestTemplate as well as in @Controller methods.
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Http method</th>
    <th>URI</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Valid HTTP Status Code</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>POST</td>
    <td>/books</td>
    <td>Create a book</td>
    <td>201</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>GET</td>
    <td>/books/{bookId}</td>
    <td>Read a Book</td>
    <td>200</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>PUT</td>
    <td>/books/{bookId}</td>
    <td>Update a Book</td>
    <td>200</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>DELETE</td>
    <td>/books/{bookId}</td>
    <td>Delete a Book</td>
    <td>204</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>GET</td>
    <td>/books</td>
    <td>Retrive all Books</td>
    <td>200, 204, 206</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## How to connect Application with Database Using JPA
* Add two dependencies -> Spring Data JPA, MYSQL Connector
```
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
</dependency>

<dependency>
	<groupId>mysql</groupId>
	<artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
	<version>8.0.33</version>
</dependency>
```
* Add @Entity, @Table(name = "books"), @Id and @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO) in entity Class
* Open MySql Command Line and create a database. EX- create database spring_db;
* In application.properties file add
```
spring.datasource.name = spring_db
spring.datasource.url = jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/spring_db
spring.datasource.username= root
spring.datasource.password= root
spring.datasource.driver-class-name= com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect = org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = update
```
* Create a Dao class (Ex- BookRepository) and extend the CRUDRepository in the file.
* In the service file, create the object of  BookRepository by autowired;
* Get the data -> using objName.findAll(), objName.findById(Id)
* Create the data -> using save()
* Delete the data -> using deleteById()
* Update the data -> using save()

### Difference Between @JsonManagedReference & @JsonBackReference
@JsonManagedReference:
* Used on the "owning" side of the relationship, i.e., the side that manages the relationship (controls the foreign key).
* Indicates that the annotated property should be serialized normally (included in the JSON output) and also serves as the forward part of the reference.
* When using @JsonManagedReference, Jackson will include the property marked with this annotation during serialization.
```
@Entity
public class Parent {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @JsonManagedReference
    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "parent")
    private List<Child> children;

    // Other fields and methods
}
```
@JsonBackReference:
* Used on the "non-owning" side of the relationship, i.e., the side that is not responsible for managing the relationship.
* Indicates that the annotated property should be ignored during serialization to avoid infinite recursion.
* When using @JsonBackReference, Jackson will not include the property marked with this annotation during serialization.
```
@Entity
public class Child {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @JsonBackReference
    @ManyToOne
    private Parent parent;

    // Other fields and methods
}
```

## Upload a file in a Directory
### 1. In Static Path
In PostMan - <br>
Select POST as a method -> Go to body -> select form-data -> select file as a key -> Give key name and upload image as value <br>
In SpringBoot <br>
There are two methods- <br>
```
Helper Class
@Component
public class FileUploadHelper {
public final String UPLOAD_DIR = "C:\\Users\\hp\\eclipse-workspace\\FileUpload\\src\\main\\resources\\static\\Image"; //This is the path where you want to store the file
	
	public boolean uploadFile(MultipartFile file) {
		
		boolean uploadStatus = false;
		
		try {
`			FIRST METHOD ---------------------------
			//Read file
			InputStream is = file.getInputStream();
			byte data[] = new byte[is.available()];
			is.read();
			
			//Write file
			FileOutputStream op = new FileOutputStream(UPLOAD_DIR + "\\" + file.getOriginalFilename());
			op.write(data);
			op.flush();
			op.close();

			SECOND METHOD ----------------------------------
			Files.copy(file.getInputStream(), Paths.get(UPLOAD_DIR + "\\" + file.getOriginalFilename()) , StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);
			
			uploadStatus = true;
			
		}catch(Exception e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
			uploadStatus =  false;
		}
		
		return uploadStatus;
		
	}
}

```
```
Controller Class----
@RestController
public class FileUploadController {
	@Autowired
	private FileUploadHelper fileUploadHelper;
	
	@PostMapping("/upload-file")
	public ResponseEntity<String> uploadFile(@RequestParam("file") MultipartFile file) {
		//File Upload Code
		try {
			//file upload Code
			boolean status = fileUploadHelper.uploadFile(file);
			
			if(status) {
				return ResponseEntity.ok("File is successfully uploaded");
			}
			
		} catch (Exception e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
		
		return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR).body("Error in uploading file");
	}
}
```
* Add dependencies in application.properties file
```
spring.servlet.multipart.enabled= true
spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size = 300MB
spring.servlet.multipart.file-size-threshold = 1KB
```
### 2. In Dynamic Path
* We use ClassPathResource to get images in a dynamic path.
* It will work when the constructor is called.
```
public final String UPLOAD_DIR = new ClassPathResource("/static/Image").getFile().getAbsolutePath();
```
* In Controller Class, return
```
return ResponseEntity.ok(ServletUriComponentsBuilder.fromCurrentContextPath().path("/Image/").path(file.getOriginalFilename()).toUriString());
```

## Thymeleaf
* Thymeleaf is a modern server-side Java template engine for both web and stand-alone environments, capable of processing HTML, XML, JavaScript, CSS, and even plain text.
* It is used in spring-boot in place of jsp. We can use JSP also but Thymleaf is a modern way to create html templates. 
* The goal is to provide an elegant and highly maintainable way of creating templates.
* It is similar to HTML. Extension of thymeleaf file is .html 
* Rendering (Evaluation of dynamic content) will be on the server side.
* Mostly used to generate HTML views for web applications.
* Thymeleaf template = HTML + Thymeleaf Expression -> Can access Java Code, Object, and Spring beans.
* The Thymeleaf engine will parse thymeleaf template.
